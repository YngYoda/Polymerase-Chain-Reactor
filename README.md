Polymerase-Chain-Reactor
========================

An Open Source PCR machine for DIY Recombinant Genetics, and entry to the Hackaday Prize! If you like it, please Skull it at http://hackaday.io/project/1864-%245-Polymerase-Chain-Reactor

This project describes the designs for a remarkably simple but fully functional DNA replicator, based around the Arduino platform, and utilizing just a handful of components. The trick is to use multiple physical process driven by just heat! Heat drives DNA conversion between its single and double strand state; alters the activity of the polymerase to copy DNA; and drives circulation of the reaction medium via convection. So, it's all and heat and geometry, intead of trying to shift temperature as fast and accurately as possible with expensive hardware. 

It uses the Arduino libraries, and the Arduino PID Library by Brett Beauregard.

Eagle schematics and a boards layout files are also included.

The project is GPLv3 licenced
