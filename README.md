Polymerase-Chain-Reactor
========================

An Open Source PCR machine for DIY Recombinant Genetics, and entry to the Hackaday Prize! If you like it, please Skull it at http://hackaday.io/project/1864-%245-Polymerase-Chain-Reactor

This project contains the designs for a remarkably simple but functional DNA replicator, based around an Arduino platform, and utilizing just a handful of components. The key trick use is relying of the physical process of heat on DNA conversion between its single and double strand state, heat dependent activity of the polymerase, and heat driven circulation of the reaction medium via convection. So, its all and heat (and geometry), intead of trying to move temperature as fast and possible.

Eagle schematics and a boards layout files are also included.
