Polymerase-Chain-Reactor
========================

An Open Source PCR machine for DIY Recombinant Genetics, and entry to the Hackaday Prize! If you like it, please Skull it at http://hackaday.io/project/1864-%245-Polymerase-Chain-Reactor

This project contains the designs for a remarkably simple but fully functional DNA replicator, based around the Arduino platform, and utilizing just a handful of components. The trick use is relying on the physical process driven by heat! It drives DNA conversion between its single and double strand state; the activity of the polymerase to copy DNA; and to drive circulation of the reaction medium via convection. So, its all and heat (and geometry), intead of trying to move temperature as fast and possible.

Eagle schematics and a boards layout files are also included.

The project is GPLv3 licenced
